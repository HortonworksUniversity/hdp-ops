*Blueprints*

To install a 4 node HDP 2.2 cluster on the HDP Ops course VM, with the same configuration as students follow during the the UI-based install labs, run the following command from the Ubuntu host on the VM (assuming internet connectivity):

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HortonworksUniversity/hdp-ops/HDP2.2/blueprints/install_cluster.sh | bash
```
